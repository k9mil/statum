## Working on

The backlog of the features yet to be implemented are available on a public Trello workspace which can be viewed at [statum, board](https://trello.com/b/b6WPU1j8/statum-board).

## Demo Server

A demo server is available, on a Heroku deno: [statoom](https://statoom.herokuapp.com/). *note: may or may not be up-to-date.

## Installation process

If you wish to run this web app locally, [Python](https://www.python.org/) will be **necessary** for you to be able to run this web application.

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is necessary for the functionality of the web app, so some knowledge is required and MongoDB is required to be installed on your local machine.

1. To host this web app, you need to register a [Twitch](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps/create) Application which will server as the basis of this program.
2. After you have registered the Twitch Application, you have to click "Manage" and locate the "CLIENT ID" which you can paste in the config.py file.
3. Generate an OAuth token, after that, you have to put that in the config.py file aswell.
4. Open your terminal/command line where the source code for statum is located.
5. Install the dependencies needed via "pip install -r requirements.txt" (if that doesn't work, try pip3 instead of pip)
6. Setup the app for flask: $env:FLASK_APP="statum"
7. Setup the environment variables for flask: "$env:FLASK_ENV="development" (optional, debug mode)
8. Run the flask web app via "flask run". 

After that, you're set.
